convert vs 2010 project to 64 bit

properties>configuration manager - set to 64 bit 

this is due to trying to compile against a 64 bit library in 32 bit mode, not compatible

change directory in visual studio console using cd %ARNOLD_PATH%

doing things across different directories didn't work to well

for testing I had to put the new dll in the same folder as the kicker exe


commands used:

see images folder
