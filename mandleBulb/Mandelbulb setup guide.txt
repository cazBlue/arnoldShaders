mandleBuld setup:

There are two key elements to rendering the Mandelbulb with Arnold spheres
1:.dll file
	The dll file must be compiled against the currently installed version of Arnold
	the version currently compiled with this document is for Arnold Core 4.2.4.1
	Know the url for the .dll
	
2: .ass file
	this file is loaded into an Arnold stand in object. This is a simple text file and can be opened as such
	You must ensure the following path matches your current setup
	
	dso "" must be the path to the compiled dll
	
	Values changed in this document will alter aspects of the Mandelbulb

rendering sequences:
If you want to render an animated sequence first work out which values of the mandelbulb you want to animate (what values need to change how much per frame)

we can then modify the batch.py to generate a sequence of .ass files, one for each frame

the standIn should follow the following naming convention:

mandelbulb.##.ass
	where mandelbulb is the filename

Required expression for frame update
	the frame attribute on the arnoldStandInShape does not auto update. Attach the following expression
	ArnoldStandInShape.frameNumber = frame
	where ArnoldStandInShape is the name of the shape
	(example scene included in bulba_Project)
